        "llm_output": "To add numbers in base 6, we follow the same basic rules as adding numbers in base 10, but we carry over when the sum reaches 6.\n\nStarting with the rightmost digit, we add the digits, remembering to carry over whenever we reach 6.\n\n$4_6 + 14_6 = 20_6$ (We need to carry over because 2 + 0 = 2, which is 2 more than 6)\n\nNow, we bring down the next digit, 0, and add it to the sum.\n\n$20_6 + 0_6 = 22_6$ (Again, we carry over)\n\nNow, we add the next digit, 0, to the sum.\n\n$22_6 + 0_6 = 22_6$\n\nFinally, we have no more digits to add, so the sum is $22_6$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of $4_6$ and $14_6$ in base 6 is $\\boxed{22_6}$.",
